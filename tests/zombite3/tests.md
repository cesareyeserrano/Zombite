## Functional

### TC-1
- Title: Validate us-1 primary behavior.
- Trace: US-1, FR-1, AC-1
- Steps:
  1) Given a running wave with at least one civilian visible
  2) When the player left-clicks and hits that civilian
  3) Then score decreases by 50, player life decreases by 15 (or one equivalent strike as specified), and the game shows visual and audio penalty feedback immediately

### TC-2
- Title: Validate us-2 primary behavior.
- Trace: US-2, FR-2, AC-1
- Steps:
  1) Given a running wave with at least one civilian visible
  2) When the player left-clicks and hits that civilian
  3) Then score decreases by 50, player life decreases by 15 (or one equivalent strike as specified), and the game shows visual and audio penalty feedback immediately

## Negative / Abuse

### TC-3
- Title: Handle edge behavior - A single shot frame may overlap multiple entities near the crosshair (for example a civilian crossing in front of a zombie), so hit resolution priority and penalties must be deterministic and consistent.
- Trace: US-1, FR-1
- Steps:
  1) Given a single shot frame may overlap multiple entities near the crosshair (for example a civilian crossing in front of a zombie), so hit resolution priority and penalties must be deterministic and consistent
  2) When the relevant workflow is executed
  3) Then the system returns a deterministic failure-safe response

## Security

### TC-4
- Title: Enforce security control - Do not execute untrusted remote code or dynamic scripts; keep gameplay assets local and validated, and avoid exposing admin/debug endpoints in the dev server build.
- Trace: US-1, FR-1
- Steps:
  1) Given threat scenario: do not execute untrusted remote code or dynamic scripts; keep gameplay assets local and validated, and avoid exposing admin/debug endpoints in the dev server build
  2) When an invalid or abusive action is attempted
  3) Then access is blocked and evidence is logged

## Edge Cases

1. A single shot frame may overlap multiple entities near the crosshair (for example a civilian crossing in front of a zombie), so hit resolution priority and penalties must be deterministic and consistent.

## Consolidated Runtime

### TC-5
- Title: Enforce fixed-camera gallery shooter view (no cursor-linked world movement).
- Trace: US-1, FR-1
- Steps:
  1) Given the play session is running
  2) When the player moves the mouse
  3) Then only the crosshair position changes and world background/lane anchors remain fixed

### TC-6
- Title: Validate lane-based depth, grounded characters, and contact shadows.
- Trace: US-1, FR-1
- Steps:
  1) Given entities are spawned in gameplay
  2) When civilians and zombies move across the scene
  3) Then they remain attached to lane ground references with depth-scaled shadows

### TC-7
- Title: Validate zombie target selection behavior and non-mouse pursuit.
- Trace: US-1, FR-1
- Steps:
  1) Given a zombie spawns while civilians are active
  2) When the player moves the crosshair
  3) Then the zombie continues pursuing civilian targets only

### TC-8
- Title: Validate consolidated damage rules and overlap priority.
- Trace: US-1, FR-1, AC-1
- Steps:
  1) Given civilians and zombies overlap near crosshair
  2) When the player fires
  3) Then zombie priority applies; civilian penalties are -50 score and -15 life; civilian loss damage remains -15 life

### TC-9
- Title: Validate level-specific enemy variants (alpha and brute) and brute loss impact.
- Trace: US-1, FR-1
- Steps:
  1) Given higher levels are active
  2) When enemy waves spawn and brute reaches a civilian
  3) Then alpha/brute behavior appears by level and brute contact applies 2 civilian losses

### TC-10
- Title: Validate airborne power-up readability and effect contract.
- Trace: US-1, FR-1, FR-2
- Steps:
  1) Given power-ups spawn during active gameplay
  2) When player shoots health or bonus power-up
  3) Then power-ups stay in aerial band (no ground shadow) and apply expected health/score/lost-civil effects

# Test Cases: zombite

> Generated by `aitri plan`.
> Spec-driven rule: every test MUST trace to a User Story (US-*) and one or more Functional Rules (FR-*). Include AC-* when applicable.
> Discovery rigor profile: deep.
> QA rule: Include broad negative, abuse, and boundary coverage from the first implementation slice.

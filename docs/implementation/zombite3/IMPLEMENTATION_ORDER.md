# Implementation Order: zombite3

Generated by `aitri implement`.

Dependency-sort policy:
- Lower dependencyScore executes first (data/model -> service -> UI/integration).
- Higher TC linkage breaks ties (stories with more verification surface first).
- US numeric order resolves remaining ties.

## Ordered Stories
1. US-1 (dependencyScore=2, tcCount=3)
2. US-2 (dependencyScore=2, tcCount=1)
